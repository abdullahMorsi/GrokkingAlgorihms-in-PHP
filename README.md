<strong>"Sometimes algorithms aren't an exact recipe. They are a framework that you build your idea on top of." </strong>
<br/><br/><strong> - This is an implementation of  all algorithms mentioned in the book, in PHP as a practice for me & as a refernce for anyone <3  </strong>
<br/><br/>A very friendly, lovely &amp; funny book. Gave you an intro to some good algorithms and data structures.
<br/>For me it was a good recap for searching and sorting algorithms and a good intro to: 
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm 
- dynamic programming  
- K- Nearest neighbors  
- Graphs &amp; Breadth-first search 
- That tired travelling salespersonðŸ˜‚
